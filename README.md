# simple-slide-angularjs
Last week I received an assessment test from a company I was applying for. It consisted of developing a simple single page application using AngularJS. I had to add a carousel that loads three slides from a json file. I had to add a button which adds additional slides to the carousel array.  The challenge was that I wasn’t familiar with AngularJS. So I immediately went on Treehouse and completed their AngularJS course to know what it’s all about and to learn key concepts. I grasped it quickly and went on to solve the challenge. I also had to reference stackoverflow with a minor problem I had - a tool I use frequently when I’m a bit stuck. I personally don’t believe you have to struggle with a problem and tear your hair out if, we as coders, have so many resources on the internet to pull from and get solutions to our problems.
